# Teenager

You know a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him (ALL CAPS).

He answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
